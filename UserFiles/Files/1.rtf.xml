\
       Tra-la-la-la-la-la-laire--nil nisi divinum stabile\
       est; caetera fumus--the gondola stopped, the old\
       palace was there, how charming its grey and pink--\
       goats and monkeys, with such hair too!--so the\
       countess passed on until she came through the\
       little park, where Niobe presented her with a\
       cabinet, and so departed.\
\
\
     Burbank crossed a little bridge\
     Descending at a small hotel;\
     Princess Volupine arrived,\
     They were together, and he fell.\
\
     Defunctive music under sea\
     Passed seaward with the passing bell\
     Slowly: the God Hercules\
     Had left him, that had loved him well.\
\
     The horses, under the axletree\
     Beat up the dawn from Istria\
     With even feet. Her shuttered barge\
     Burned on the water all the day.\
\
     But this or such was Bleistein's way:\
     A saggy bending of the knees\
     And elbows, with the palms turned out,\
     Chicago Semite Viennese.\
\
     A lustreless protrusive eye\
     Stares from the protozoic slime\
     At a perspective of Canaletto.\
     The smoky candle end of time\
\
     Declines. On the Rialto once.\
     The rats are underneath the piles.\
     The jew is underneath the lot.\
     Money in furs. The boatman smiles,\
\
     Princess Volupine extends\
     A meagre, blue-nailed, phthisic hand\
     To climb the waterstair. Lights, lights,\
     She entertains Sir Ferdinand\
\
     Klein. Who clipped the lion's wings\
     And flea'd his rump and pared his claws?\
     Thought Burbank, meditating on\
     Time's ruins, and the seven laws.\

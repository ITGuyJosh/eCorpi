A Tag Management System &amp; Visualisation Platform for the Digital Humanities

## Abstract
Over the past few decades, Visual Analytics has been applied to large dataset analysis to circumvent information overload and return meaningful insight. Additionally, the Digital Humanities are seeking computational approaches to assist their research in providing context and meaning to unstructured literary texts. Currently, the University of Chester Digital Humanities department uses a time consuming process of marking up literary works by hand. As a result, a case study has been provided by the university to develop a web-based visualisation tool that combines the power of Visual Analytics with the Digital Humanities use case. An all-in-one, accessible, text analysis system, which allows relationships and trends to viewed visually via a XML tagging interface was created to achieve this.  The results of the implementation show that insight can be gathered using a visual analytics approach for literary works, however to understand the necessary method to achieve this most effectively requires future work.

### Aim
To create a web-based visualisation tool that undertakes text analysis for Digital Humanities literature. It will reveal contextual relationships and meanings of the content, primarily literary sources e.g. Arthurian poems, so Digital Humanities members can perform effective decision making of complex data sets.

###Objectives
- Creating a web-based visualisation tool,
- Discovering whether visual analytics is appropriate for analysing complex data sets, as applied to the digital humanities,
- Discovering whether interactive visualisation tools enable gaining insight into problems, as applied to the digital humanities.
